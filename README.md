# Out of this World Cafe

Out of this World Cafe was developed during the hackathon, **FullyHacks 2025**, at California State University, Fullerton on April 12, 2025 - April 13, 2025, with over 400 participants, and won **Best Game Project**. 

## Our Team
* Dianella Sy - Programmer, Audio/Transition Manager
* Emily Tsai - Programmer, Artist, Writer
* Lukas Lin - Programmer, Writer

## Inspiration
We got inspiration from posts we saw on Pinterest of animal drawings, and we wanted to draw a similar style of animals and implement them in a space game. After learning the space theme in the opening ceremony, we thought of animals being stranded in space and having to rescue them by winning over their hearts with ice cream (we were craving ice cream and who doesn't love ice cream!). We also wanted to address issues of animal cruelty and animal abandonment, as our game represents ensuring every animal is given a loving home and is properly taken care of.

## What Our Game Does
Out of this World Cafe is a restaurant tycoon video game where a group of animals have been stranded in space for a period of time, in the hopes of finding a loving owner and getting to eat their favorite food, ice cream. 

## How We Built It
We developed the game utilizing C#, Unity Version 6000.0.42f1, and Visual Studio Code. We also used GitHub Desktop for version control and merge conflict resolution.

## Challenges We Ran Into
There were problems with getting the input handler to fully working, which was resolved by optimizing our object colliders and scripts. Additionally, since all of our group members were working on the project at the same time and importing different packages at once, we ran into merge conflicts. We resolved this by inspecting overlapping changes and took preventative measures by creating independent workspace scenes and better commit tracking.

## Accomplishments that We're Proud of
This is our first hackathon, and we are so proud of ourselves that we completed a project in less than 24 hours!

## What We Learned
We developed our technical skills on how to build a completed game in Unity and the different components in the IDE. In addition, we also developed our soft skills, where we gained experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and rapid prototyping.

## What's Next for Out of this World Cafe
We are planning to add an endless party mode in addition to the current story mode we have implemented. The user must serve the animals the correct ice cream and toppings in a certain amount of time until they run out of lives/attempts.
