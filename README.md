# Out of this World Cafe

Out of this World Cafe was developed during the hackathon, **Fullyhacks 2025**, at California State University, Fullerton on April 12, 2025 - April 13, 2025, with over 4,000 participants, and won **Best Game Project**. 

## Our Team
* Dianella Sy - Programmer, Audio/Transition Manager
* Emily Tsai - Programmer, Artist, Writer
* Lukas Lin - Programmer, Writer

## Inspiration
We got inspiration from posts we saw on Pinterest of animal drawings, and we wanted to draw a similar style of animals and implement them in a space game. After learning the space theme in the opening ceremony, we thought of what if they were stranded in space and they could come home to Earth if the user served them ice cream (ice cream because we were craving ice cream and who doesn't love ice cream!). We also wanted to address animal cruelty and showcase how it is disrespectful to not treat animals the same way we would not like to be treated, so our game demonstrates one way we can give back and give them treats to show them how much we love and appreciate them.

## What Our Game Does
Out of this World Cafe is a restaurant tycoon video game where different animals are sent to space and stranded for a period of time. In order for them to return to Earth, they must be served ice cream, and if they are satisfied, they will decide to return with the cafe owner back home. 

## How We Built It
We developed the game utilizing C#, and our IDEs are Unity and Visual Studio Code. We also used GitHub Desktop, where we all contributed to the GitHub repository.

## Challenges We Ran Into
There were problems with getting the input handler fully working. We imported an asset in Unity's Asset Store called LeanTween, which enabled us to make transitions smoothly without having to utilize the Animator in Unity. However, there were some conflicts with the function name we called in the dialogue scripts, and LeanTween said it did not recognize the function, but it was not coming from there. In the end, we fixed the compiler issues and both LeanTween and the dialogue work.

## Accomplishments that We're Proud of
This is our first hackathon, and we are so proud of ourselves that we completed a project in less than 24 hours!

## What We Learned
We developed our technical skills on how to build a completed game in Unity and the different components in the IDE. In addition, we also developed our soft skills, where we gained experience in teamwork, problem-solving, and rapid prototyping.

## What's Next for Out of this World Cafe
We would add an endless party mode where the user had 3 lives, meaning the user must serve the animals the correct ice cream and toppings in a certain amount of time; they get 3 attempts if they serve the order wrong or they run out of time. 

Overall, we will use all of the skills we learned in our first hackathon and create new projects outside of school using the skills we learned.
